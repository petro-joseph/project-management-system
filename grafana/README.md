# ðŸ“Š Grafana Monitoring Setup

## Overview
This monitoring solution delivers two pre-configured Grafana dashboards designed for comprehensive observability:  
- **System Monitoring Dashboard**: Tracks CPU, memory, disk usage, and network performance in real-time.  
- **Application Performance Dashboard**: Monitors response times, error rates, and throughput with precision.  

These dashboards exemplify my ability to implement robust, actionable monitoring in a production-ready system, providing critical insights into both infrastructure and application health.

## Accessing the Dashboards
1. **Start the Monitoring Stack**:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```  
   This initializes all monitoring services efficiently.  
2. **Access Grafana**:  
   - URL: [http://localhost/grafana](http://localhost/grafana)  
   - Username: `admin`  
   - Password: `admin`  
   Log in to explore the dashboards and metrics.  

---

## Using the Dashboards
- **Filter Metrics**: Use instance or application dropdowns to focus on specific data sets.  
- **View Details**: Hover over panels for in-depth metric breakdowns.  
- **Customize Panels**: Click panel titles to edit or inspect underlying queries as needed.  

---

## Setting Up Alerts
1. In Grafana, go to `Alerting > Notification Channels`.  
2. Configure a new channel (e.g., Email, Slack) for alert delivery.  
3. Set up panel-specific alerts:  
   - Click the panel title > `Edit` > `Alert`.  
   - Define conditions and thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%).  
   - Link to your chosen notification channel.  
   This ensures proactive system monitoring with timely notifications.

## Adding New Metrics
1. **Enhance Prometheus**: Update the Prometheus configuration with additional metrics.  
2. **Integrate in Grafana**:  
   - Select the `+` icon > `Add Panel`.  
   - Craft Prometheus queries to visualize the new data.  
   - Save to an existing dashboard or create a new one.  
   This flexibility supports evolving monitoring needs.

## Importing Dashboards
To deploy these dashboards to another Grafana instance:  
1. **Export**: Download the JSON files from each dashboard in Grafana.  
2. **Import**:  
   - Navigate to `+` > `Import` in the target Grafana.  
   - Upload the JSON files.  
   - Connect to the Prometheus data source.  
   This enables seamless replication across environments.  

---

## Accessing Prometheus
- **URL**: [http://localhost/prometheus](http://localhost/prometheus)  
- **Capabilities**:  
  - Use the Expression Browser to test and refine Prometheus queries.  
  - Verify metric collection via the `Targets` tab.  
  Prometheus serves as the reliable backbone for all monitoring data.
